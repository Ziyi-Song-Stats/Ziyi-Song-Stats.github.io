I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.uci.edu/) at the University of California, Irvine. I work with [Prof. Michele Guindani (now at UCLA)](https://www.micheleguindani.info/) and [Prof. Weining Shen](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/weinings/). I have also been working with [Prof. Federico Camerlenghi](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/camerlenghi-federico/) and [Prof. Mario Beraha](https://sites.google.com/view/marioberaha) since my visit to the Department of Economics, Management and Statistics at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Milan, Italy, in 2025.

My research interests include Bayesian nonparametrics, random partition models, random measures, point processes, repulsive mixture models, and spatio-temporal and functional data analysis.
