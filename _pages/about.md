I work with [Prof. Michele Guindani (now at UCLA)](https://www.micheleguindani.info/) and [Prof. Weining Shen (UCI)](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/weinings/). I have been working with [Prof. Federico Camerlenghi](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/camerlenghi-federico/) and [Prof. Mario Beraha](https://sites.google.com/view/marioberaha) since my visit to the Department of Economics, Management and Statistics at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Milan, Italy, in 2025. I am also working on a project collaborating with [Prof. Falco J. Bargagli Stoffi (UCLA)](https://www.falcobargaglistoffi.com/).

My research interests include Bayesian methods, Bayesian nonparametrics, random partition models, random measures, point processes, repulsive mixture models, spatio-temporal and functional data analysis, causal inference, statistical imaging, multi-modal integration, neuroscience, behavioral science, and biomedical applications.
